        *This generator does not take into consideration the fickleness of your
        superintendent. Yea, superintendents are fickle - you got a problem with
        that?

      <h2>Hold up - where does the number come from?</h2>
      <p>
        Using your location, we fetch weather data from weather underground and
        use the current date, the high and low temperature, the average wind
        speed, and the daily and instantaneous snowfall. We plug your data into
        a neural network trained with existing snow day data from schools in
        Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo.
      </p>
      <h2>Why is this better than other snow day calculators?</h2>
      <p>
        Because deep learning is a new thing and some pretty amazing problems
        can be solved using technologies such as neural nets. For example,
        Google uses neural networks to do the heavy lifting behind web translations.
